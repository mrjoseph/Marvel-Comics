# Features!

  - Browse a list of marvel characters
  - Search for your favourite character




### Tech

I took the opportunity to learn some new tech:

* [Reactjs] - JavaScript library for building user interfaces!
* [Apollo] - Open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server
* [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Nextjs] - Build server side rendered React apps
* [MaterialUI] - React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design



### Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.
This project uses a GraphQL Apollo server to talk directly to the Marvel Comics API

You will need to run the client and server in separate terminals
Open a new terminal or tab
```sh
$ cd server
$ yarn
$ yarn start:dev
```

And for the client, open a new terminal or tab
```sh
$ cd client
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

### Todos

 - Write MORE Tests. 
 I wanted to focus more on learning to combine Apollo with NextJS and Material UI for this task. Testing libraries I would like to learn include Cypress, React Testing Library
 - Clean up duplication 
 - Fix server side rendering of query
 - Set up a CI CD and AWS to gain experience and exposure for future projects
