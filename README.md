# Features!

  - Browse a list of marvel characters
  - Search for your favourite character




### Tech

I took the opportunity to learn some new tech:

* [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces!
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) - Open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](http://expressjs.com) - Fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) - Build server side rendered React apps
* [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design



### Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.
This project uses a GraphQL Apollo server to talk directly to the Marvel Comics API

You will need to run the client and server in separate terminals

Open a new terminal or tab
```sh
$ cd server
$ yarn
$ yarn start:dev
```

And for the client, open a new terminal or tab
```sh
$ cd client
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

### Todos

* Write Tests!. 
wanted to focus more on learning to combine Apollo with NextJS and Material UI for this task. Testing libraries I would like to learn include Cypress, React Testing Library
* Clean up duplication 
* Fix server side rendering of query
* Set up a CI CD and AWS to gain experience and exposure for future projects
